# Chapter 12 Companion Code

This repository contains the code developed in Chapter 12 ("Obtaining User Data through Controlled Forms").

This repo starts out with a copy of the HTML for the "Rounds" form from Ch. 8.   From there, we walk through the coding examples in Chapter 12:
 * Task 1 (ch12s1): Create starter controlled component for Round Form
 * Task 2 (ch12s2): TBD
 
 
To increase your engagement, consider cloning this repo and following along with the chapter and/or a live coding demonstration of the chapter's code.
